LTC2662: 5-Channel 16-/12-Bit 300mA SoftSpan Current Source DACs

@verbatim

The LTC2662 is a family of 5-channel, 16-/12-bit current source digital-to-analog converters with precision
integrated reference and accurate full-scale current. The LTC2662 is guaranteed monotonic and offers independent
SoftSpan programmability of the current output range from 3.125mA to 300mA.

The LTC2662 provides a separate VDD0-4 supply for each OUT0-4 channel. The flexible VDD0-4 supply allows
operation from 2.85V to 33V. Internal 12 ohm switches allow any OUT0-4 pin to be connected to an optional
negative V- supply voltage and sink up to 80mA.

The SPI/Microwire-compatible 3-wire serial interface operates on logic levels as low as 1.71V, at clock
rates up to 50MHz.
